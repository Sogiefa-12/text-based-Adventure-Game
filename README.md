# Overview
This project aims to create a simple text-based adventure game using the Rust programming language. As a software engineer to enhance my skills and explore new technologies, this projects serves as an opportunity to dive into Rust's unique features, syntax, and best practices. By building a functioning game, I hope to gain hands-on experience with Rust while creating an engaging and entertaining application


# Project Description
The software is a text-based adventure game where players navigate various scenarios and make choices that impact the story's direction. The game features characters with attributes, turn-based gameplay, and a range of possible outcomes based on player decisions.

# Purpose
The purpose of creating this software is to learn and apply Rust programming language concepts in a practical and enjoyable context. This project will help me develop skills in game development, problem-solving, and utilizing Rust's features, such as its ownership model, error handling, and memory safety.

# Development Environment

The primary tools used for developing this software include:
- Visual Studio Code: A lightweight and versatile code editor with excellent support for Rust through extensions.
- Cargo: Rust's built-in package manager for handling dependecies and building projects.
Rust compiler: for checking code correctness and generating executable binaries.

The programming language used for this project is Rust, a statically-typed, systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Rust offers strong memory safety guarantees without requiring a garbage collector, making it suitable for creating fast, efficient applications
